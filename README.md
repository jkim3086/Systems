# Systems
_Implemented Virtual Memory, Caching, and Multithreading_

### Virtual Memory
Implemented a virtual memeory system, which is a part of a given simulator that manages memory models.

**Tasks**
- Split addresses
- Address translation
- Computing EMAT(Estimated Memory Access Time)
- Handling Page Faults
- Improving Page Replacement
- Implementing a TLB(Translation Lookaside Buffer)

### Caching
Implemented a three functions for caching into a given driver

**Functions**
- Cache initialization by implementing cache_init function
- Cache access(Read & Write) by implementing cache_access function 
- Cache clean-up by implementing cache_cleanup function

### Multithreading
Implemented three differnt scheduling algorithms for multithreading base on a multiprocessor operating system simulator using pthreads.

**Scheduling Algorithms**
- FIFO(First In, First Out)
- Round Robin
- Static Priority
